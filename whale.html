      The blue whale is the largest animal ever known to have existed, <br>
      reaching lengths of up to 100 feet and weights of up to 200 tons. <br>
      Found in oceans across the globe, this immense marine mammal is known for <br>
      its deep, resonant calls that can travel great distances underwater. <br>
      Despite their enormous size, blue whales primarily feed on tiny krill, <br>
      consuming several tons per day during feeding season. <br>
      Blue whales play a crucial role in marine ecosystems, <br>
      influencing the health of ocean environments through their feeding and migratory patterns.<br> 
      Their populations are monitored closely as they face threats from <br>
      ship strikes and entanglements, along with the impacts of climate change.
