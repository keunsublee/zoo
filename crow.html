      The crow is an intelligent bird 
      known for problem-solving skills and adaptability. 

      Crows are found all over the world 
      and are easily recognized by their black feathers, 
      sharp beaks, and loud cawing. 

      They are omnivorous and can thrive in 
      diverse environments, from urban areas to forests.
